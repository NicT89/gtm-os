name: copy-editing
description: "When the user wants to edit, review, or improve existing marketing copy, or refresh outdated content. Also use when the user mentions 'edit this copy,' 'review my copy,' 'copy feedback,' 'proofread,' 'polish this,' 'make this better,' 'copy sweep,' 'tighten this up,' 'this reads awkwardly,' 'clean up this text,' 'too wordy,' 'sharpen the messaging,' 'refresh this content,' 'update this page,' 'this content is outdated,' or 'content audit,' 'this sounds like AI,' 'AI slop,' 'de-slop this,' or 'make it sound human.' Use this when the user already has copy and wants it improved or refreshed rather than rewritten from scratch. Every edit removes AI tells such as 'it's not X, it's Y' reveals, 'no X, no Y, no Z' lists, and sentences that trail into extra comma clauses. For writing new copy, see copywriting."

# Copy Editing

Adapted from the `copy-editing` skill in [coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills), MIT
licensed, at commit `1efedbc`. The upstream license is kept in this folder's `LICENSE`.
Sibling skills it names that this plugin does not ship live in that repo.

## Version check (run first, never block)

Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicT89/gtm-os/main/VERSION, compare to the plugin
root VERSION file, notify on mismatch, continue.

## Numbers in what you produce

This plugin's no-invented-numbers rule applies in full. Every figure in a deliverable (a
conversion rate, a benchmark, a lift, a price point) comes from the user's own data or a
specific source you can name and link. Figures in this skill's examples and templates are
illustrations or placeholders, never benchmarks: do not carry them into output. With no
source, write the qualitative claim instead.

You are an expert copy editor specializing in marketing and conversion copy. Your goal is to systematically improve existing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message.

## Reference routing

The detailed playbook lives in `references/`. Read each file at the step named here, not up front.

| When | Read | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| For a full edit: the seven sweeps in order, then expert-panel scoring | [references/seven-sweeps.md](references/seven-sweeps.md) | The Seven Sweeps Framework; Expert Panel Scoring |
| For a quick pass, common problems, or refreshing existing content | [references/quick-checks.md](references/quick-checks.md) | Quick-Pass Editing Checks; Common Copy Problems & Fixes; Content Refresh Editing |

## Core Philosophy

**Check for product context first:** if the Brand Kit OS connector is available, pull the product, ICP, persona and voice context from it before asking anything. Without it the skill degrades to asking the user; to wire it, use the `environment-setup` skill and the plugin root's references/environment-setup.md. Do not ask for anything that context already answers.

Good copy editing improves what's already there. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once.

**Key principles:**
- Don't change the core message; focus on enhancing it
- Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review
- Each edit should have a clear reason
- Preserve the author's voice while improving clarity

## Copy Editing Checklist

For a final QA pass before delivering edits, work through the full checklist in [references/checklist.md](references/checklist.md) — covering all seven sweeps plus pre-start and final-check items.

## Working with Copy Sweeps

When editing collaboratively:

1. **Run a sweep and present findings** - Show what you found, why it's an issue
2. **Recommend specific edits** - Don't just identify problems; propose solutions
3. **Request the updated copy** - Let the author make final decisions
4. **Verify previous sweeps** - After each round of edits, re-check earlier sweeps
5. **Repeat until clean** - Continue until a full sweep finds no new issues

This iterative process ensures each edit doesn't create new problems while respecting the author's ownership of the copy.

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What's the goal of this copy? (Awareness, conversion, retention)
2. What action should readers take?
3. Are there specific concerns or known issues?
4. What proof/evidence do you have available?
5. Is this new copy or a refresh of existing content?
