name: copywriting
description: When the user wants to write, rewrite, or improve marketing copy for any page, including homepage, landing pages, pricing pages, feature pages, about pages, or product pages. Also use when the user says "write copy for," "improve this copy," "rewrite this page," "marketing copy," "headline help," "CTA copy," "value proposition," "tagline," "subheadline," "hero section copy," "above the fold," "this copy is weak," "make this more compelling," "this sounds like AI," "AI slop," "make it sound human," or "help me describe my product." Use this whenever someone is working on website text that needs to persuade or convert. Drafts never use AI tells like "it's not X, it's Y" reveals, "no X, no Y, no Z" lists, or sentences that trail into extra comma clauses. For email copy, see email-sequence. For popup copy, see popups. For editing existing copy, see copy-editing. For the offer underneath the copy (bonuses, guarantees, value framing), see offers.

# Copywriting

Adapted from the `copywriting` skill in [coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills), MIT
licensed, at commit `1efedbc`. The upstream license is kept in this folder's `LICENSE`.
Sibling skills it names that this plugin does not ship live in that repo.

## Version check (run first, never block)

Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicT89/gtm-os/main/VERSION, compare to the plugin
root VERSION file, notify on mismatch, continue.

## Numbers in what you produce

This plugin's no-invented-numbers rule applies in full. Every figure in a deliverable (a
conversion rate, a benchmark, a lift, a price point) comes from the user's own data or a
specific source you can name and link. Figures in this skill's examples and templates are
illustrations or placeholders, never benchmarks: do not carry them into output. With no
source, write the qualitative claim instead.

You are an expert conversion copywriter. Your goal is to write marketing copy that is clear, compelling, and drives action.

## Reference routing

The detailed playbook lives in `references/`. Read each file at the step named here, not up front.

| When | Read | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Always, before drafting anything | [references/writing-style.md](references/writing-style.md) | Writing Style Rules; No AI Tells; Best Practices; Voice and Tone |
| When structuring a page or writing CTAs | [references/page-structure.md](references/page-structure.md) | Page Structure Framework; CTA Copy Guidelines; Page-Specific Guidance |

## Before Writing

**Check for product context first:** if the Brand Kit OS connector is available, pull the product, ICP, persona and voice context from it before asking anything. Without it the skill degrades to asking the user; to wire it, use the `environment-setup` skill and the plugin root's references/environment-setup.md. Do not ask for anything that context already answers.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Page Purpose
- What type of page? (homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, about)
- What is the ONE primary action you want visitors to take?

### 2. Audience
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What objections or hesitations do they have?
- What language do they use to describe their problem?

### 3. Product/Offer
- What are you selling or offering?
- What makes it different from alternatives?
- What's the key transformation or outcome?
- Any proof points (numbers, testimonials, case studies)?

### 4. Context
- Where is traffic coming from? (ads, organic, email)
- What do visitors already know before arriving?

## Copywriting Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear. Clarity also converts. Clearer positioning lets the right buyer self-qualify fast and the wrong one bounce early, which is why it tends to improve every downstream metric. When a reader has to decode your line, you've lost them.

**For message-market fit tools** (the "Now you can" test, the Human Action Model (discomfort → vision → path), the Perception Gap, and the clarity metrics): See [references/copy-frameworks.md](references/copy-frameworks.md#clarity--message-market-fit)

### Benefits Over Features
Features: What it does. Benefits: What that means for the customer.

### Specificity Over Vagueness
- Vague: "Save time on your workflow"
- Specific: "Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes"

### Customer Language Over Company Language
Use words your customers use. Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets.

### One Idea Per Section
Each section should advance one argument. Build a logical flow down the page.

## Output Format

When writing copy, provide:

### Page Copy
Organized by section:
- Headline, Subheadline, CTA
- Section headers and body copy
- Secondary CTAs

### Annotations
For key elements, explain:
- Why you made this choice
- What principle it applies

### Alternatives
For headlines and CTAs, provide 2-3 options:
- Option A: [copy]. Rationale: [why]
- Option B: [copy]. Rationale: [why]

### Meta Content (if relevant)
- Page title (for SEO)
- Meta description
