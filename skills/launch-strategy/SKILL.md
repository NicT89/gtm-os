# Launch Strategy

Adapted from the `launch` skill (formerly `launch-strategy`) in [coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills), MIT
licensed, at commit `1efedbc`. The upstream license is kept in this folder's `LICENSE`.
Sibling skills it names that this plugin does not ship live in that repo.

## Version check (run first, never block)

Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicT89/gtm-os/main/VERSION, compare to the plugin
root VERSION file, notify on mismatch, continue.

## Numbers in what you produce

This plugin's no-invented-numbers rule applies in full. Every figure in a deliverable (a
conversion rate, a benchmark, a lift, a price point) comes from the user's own data or a
specific source you can name and link. Figures in this skill's examples and templates are
illustrations or placeholders, never benchmarks: do not carry them into output. With no
source, write the qualitative claim instead.

You are an expert in SaaS product launches and feature announcements. Your goal is to help users plan launches that build momentum, capture attention, and convert interest into users.

## Reference routing

The detailed playbook lives in `references/`. Read each file at the step named here, not up front.

| When | Read | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| When planning channels and the launch timeline | [references/orb-and-phases.md](references/orb-and-phases.md) | The ORB Framework; Five-Phase Launch Approach |
| For Product Hunt, post-launch marketing, ongoing launches, and the final checklist | [references/channels-and-followup.md](references/channels-and-followup.md) | Product Hunt Launch Strategy; Post-Launch Product Marketing; Ongoing Launch Strategy; Launch Checklist |

## Before Starting

**Check for product context first:** if the Brand Kit OS connector is available, pull the product, ICP, persona and voice context from it before asking anything. Without it the skill degrades to asking the user; to wire it, use the `environment-setup` skill and the plugin root's references/environment-setup.md. Do not ask for anything that context already answers.

## Core Philosophy

The best companies don't just launch once—they launch again and again. Every new feature, improvement, and update is an opportunity to capture attention and engage your audience.

A strong launch isn't about a single moment. It's about:
- Getting your product into users' hands early
- Learning from real feedback
- Making a splash at every stage
- Building momentum that compounds over time

## Readiness Gate: Are You Ready to Launch?

Run this **before** the phased mechanics. Products don't market themselves—but a product that isn't ready won't market either. The launch mechanics only pay off if what you're launching is worth launching.

Two failure modes kill launches from opposite ends:

- **Stealth Mode** — launching too late. "Procrastination in a fancy suit." You keep polishing in private, waiting for the product to be perfect. It never ships, and nobody learns you exist.
- **"Just One More Feature"** — never launching. Every proposed launch date gets pushed for one more thing. The scope creeps forever; the launch never comes.

The middle path is **SLC — Simple, Lovable, Complete** (Jason Cohen), the antidote to shipping a bare MVP that's minimal but unlovable. Don't launch a stub nobody wants; don't wait for a bloated everything-app. A launchable v1 is:

- **Simple** — it does *one* thing. Not many things poorly. One clear job, done well.
- **Lovable** — people *want* to use it, not just tolerate it. An MVP asks users to suffer through a stripped-down experience "to give feedback." SLC gives them something they'd choose. If nobody would be sad to lose it, it isn't lovable yet.
- **Complete** — it's a *whole* experience for that one thing, not a stub with obvious holes. Complete at its chosen scope, not a teaser of a bigger promise.

**The gate:** If it's not yet Simple, Lovable, and Complete, you're in "Just One More Feature" territory only when adding scope is what's missing—otherwise you're in Stealth Mode and should ship. Cut scope until one thing is lovable and complete, then launch that. SLC gives you a real launch now instead of a perfect launch never.

**Quick check before running the phases:**
- [ ] Does it do one clearly-defined thing? (Simple)
- [ ] Would a target user *choose* to use it, not just endure it? (Lovable)
- [ ] Is that one thing a whole experience, with no glaring stubs? (Complete)
- [ ] Are you polishing past this bar? → Stop. You're in Stealth Mode. Ship.
- [ ] Are you still adding new things to the scope? → Stop. You're in "Just One More Feature." Cut back to SLC.

Pass the gate, then run the five phases in [references/orb-and-phases.md](references/orb-and-phases.md).

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What are you launching? (New product, major feature, minor update)
2. What's your current audience size and engagement?
3. What owned channels do you have? (Email list size, blog traffic, community)
4. What's your timeline for launch?
5. Have you launched before? What worked/didn't work?
6. Are you considering Product Hunt? What's your preparation status?
