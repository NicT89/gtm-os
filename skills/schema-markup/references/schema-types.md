# schema-markup: schema types

Split out of this skill's SKILL.md; read it at the step the SKILL.md routing table names.

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy First
- Schema must accurately represent page content
- Don't markup content that doesn't exist
- Keep updated when content changes

### 2. Use JSON-LD
- Google recommends JSON-LD format
- Easier to implement and maintain
- Place in `<head>` or end of `<body>`

### 3. Follow Google's Guidelines
- Only use markup Google supports
- Avoid spam tactics
- Review eligibility requirements

### 4. Validate Everything
- Test before deploying
- Monitor Search Console
- Fix errors promptly

## Common Schema Types

| Type | Use For | Required Properties |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Organization | Company homepage/about | name, url |
| WebSite | Homepage/site identity | name, url |
| Article | Blog posts, news | headline, image, datePublished, author |
| Product | Product pages | name, image, offers |
| SoftwareApplication | SaaS/app pages | name, offers |
| FAQPage | FAQ content | mainEntity (Q&A array) |
| HowTo | Tutorials | name, step |
| BreadcrumbList | Any page with breadcrumbs | itemListElement |
| LocalBusiness | Local business pages | name, address |
| Event | Events, webinars | name, startDate, location |

**For complete JSON-LD examples**: See [references/schema-examples.md](schema-examples.md)

### Check Google Feature Support First

Schema.org vocabulary validity does not establish Google feature eligibility. Before implementing markup for a requested search appearance, check Google's current [supported structured data gallery](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery).

- **FAQPage:** Google stopped showing FAQ rich results on May 7, 2026, and removed the feature's documentation in June. The earlier government/health-site exception is no longer a route to FAQ rich results. See Google's [documentation updates](https://developers.google.com/search/updates).
- **HowTo:** Google retired HowTo rich results in September 2023. See the [retirement announcement](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/08/howto-faq-changes).
- **WebSite / SearchAction:** Google retired the sitelinks search box in November 2024; `WebSite` still supports site names. See the [search box announcement](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/10/sitelinks-search-box).

These types can still describe matching visible content in Schema.org. Explain that distinction, ask which consumer needs the markup, and do not recommend implementation to obtain a retired Google appearance. Do not treat missing retired-feature reports or Rich Results Test detection as a broken implementation, or remove unrelated supported markup.

## Quick Reference

### Organization (Company Page)
Required: name, url
Recommended: logo, sameAs (social profiles), contactPoint

### Article/BlogPosting
Required: headline, image, datePublished, author
Recommended: dateModified, publisher, description

### Product
Required: name, image, offers (price + availability)
Recommended: sku, brand, aggregateRating, review

### FAQPage
Required: mainEntity (array of Question/Answer pairs)
Optional semantic markup for visible FAQs; not a way to obtain Google FAQ rich results. Check the feature-support guidance above before offering code.

### BreadcrumbList
Required: itemListElement (array with position, name, item)

## Multiple Schema Types

You can combine multiple schema types on one page using `@graph`:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://example.com/#organization" },
    { "@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://example.com/#website" },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [] }
  ]
}
```
